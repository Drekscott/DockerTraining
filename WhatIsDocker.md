# Docker Explained

## What is Docker?
> A containerization technology that enables the creation and usage of containers.

## What are containers?
> A container is a set of one or more processes that are isolated from the rest of the system. All the files necessary to run them are provided from a distinct image, meaning that Linux containers are portable and consistent as they move from development, to testing, and finally to production

## Why use Docker?
> You are able to create, deploy, and move applications/solutions/tools from different environments w/ Docker. The container that you will create will have all of the necessary libraries, dependencies and files needed so that you can go from developmen to production. Docker makes it easier to host applications locally or in the cloud.

> Container images provide portability and version control, helping ensure that what works on a developerâ€™s laptop also works in production

## Containerization v. Virtualization
* Virtualization lets your operating systems (Windows or Linux) run simultaneously on a single hardware system.  
---
* Containers share the same operating system kernel and isolate the application process from the rest of the system.
